# Disruptions in Health Screening and Their Impact on Chronic Disease Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Korea

- Authors: [Sok Chul Hong](https://sites.google.com/site/sokchulhong/), Inhyuk Hwang

**Abstract:**
This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on national health screenings and subsequent changes in chronic disease management using the case of Korea, where strict quarantine policies were not implemented. We use pre-pandemic periods to estimate a counterfactual for screening rates during the pandemic. This approach reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced health screening rates in 2020. The decline was greater in groups more likely to benefit from screening, those at higher risk of chronic disease. Next, we analyze the impact of disruptions in screening on chronic disease management. To mitigate potential selection bias in screening, propensity score matching is employed. The results show that those who missed screenings could have initiated necessary healthcare to manage their chronic conditions if they had been screened. Delays in screening exacerbated the severity of disease when initiating treatment. These findings are robust to both the event study approach and the model that accounts for heterogeneity in the timing of screening across individuals. Overall, the health costs of the COVID-19 pandemic extend beyond the virus itself, as disruptions in preventive care may lead to long-term health consequences.

# The National Immunization Program for Children Expanded: Its Impact on Influenza Vaccination and Healthcare Use

**Abstract:**
This study examines the impact of expanding the eligible age for child influenza vaccinations in Korea. To control for time trends in influenza vaccination rates, I estimate a difference-in-differences model using children not affected by the age expansion as a control group. Through this model, I find that expanding the program's eligible age significantly increased the vaccination rate of children aged 5-12 in the treatment group. This increase is mainly observed among households with incomes above the median, those with working mothers, and those living in areas with high access to healthcare facilities. Next, I use  National Health Information Database from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to analyze changes in influenza-related healthcare utilization as the program's eligible age expanded. The results show that the estimates from the difference-in-differences model are not robust to time-varying confounding factors related to influenza incidence. To address this, I estimate a triple difference model that exploits temporal variation in the match between the influenza vaccine and prevalent viruses. The results show that influenza-related healthcare utilization decreased during periods of high match rates after the policy was implemented.
