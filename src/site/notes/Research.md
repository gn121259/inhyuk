## Disruptions in Health Screening and Their Impact on Chronic Disease Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Korea

- Authors: [Sok Chul Hong](https://sites.google.com/site/sokchulhong/), Inhyuk Hwang

**Abstract:**
This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on national health screenings and subsequent changes in chronic disease management using the case of Korea, where strict quarantine policies were not implemented. We use pre-pandemic periods to estimate a counterfactual for screening rates during the pandemic. This approach reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced health screening rates in 2020. The decline was greater in groups more likely to benefit from screening, those at higher risk of chronic disease. Next, we analyze the impact of disruptions in screening on chronic disease management. To mitigate potential selection bias in screening, propensity score matching is employed. The results show that those who missed screenings could have initiated necessary healthcare to manage their chronic conditions if they had been screened. Delays in screening exacerbated the severity of disease when initiating treatment. These findings are robust to both the event study approach and the model that accounts for heterogeneity in the timing of screening across individuals. Overall, the health costs of the COVID-19 pandemic extend beyond the virus itself, as disruptions in preventive care may lead to long-term health consequences.

## The National Immunization Program for Children Expanded: Its Impact on Influenza Vaccination and Healthcare Use

**Abstract:**
This study examines the impact of expanding the eligible age for child influenza vaccinations in Korea. To control for time trends in influenza vaccination rates, I estimate a difference-in-differences model using children not affected by the age expansion as a control group. Through this model, I find that expanding the program's eligible age significantly increased the vaccination rate of children aged 5-12 in the treatment group. This increase is mainly observed among households with incomes above the median, those with working mothers, and those living in areas with high access to healthcare facilities. Next, I use  National Health Information Database from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to analyze changes in influenza-related healthcare utilization as the program's eligible age expanded. The results show that the estimates from the difference-in-differences model are not robust to time-varying confounding factors related to influenza incidence. To address this, I estimate a triple difference model that exploits temporal variation in the match between the influenza vaccine and prevalent viruses. The results show that influenza-related healthcare utilization decreased during periods of high match rates after the policy was implemented.

## Impact of Negative News about Covid-19 Vaccine on the Choice of Vaccination

- Authors: Inhyuk Hwang, Sangbeom Kim, Dae-il Kim, [Sok Chul Hong](https://sites.google.com/site/sokchulhong/)

**Abstract:**
 Informed decision-making is a fundamental mechanism within society, exemplified by vaccination choices. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination emerged as a crucial strategy for mitigating societal risks, yet uncertainty surrounding vaccine side effects persisted. This uncertainty is often exacerbated by the overwhelming volume of information available, leading individuals to selectively engage with preferred news narratives. This study examines the impact of exposure to negative information about vaccines on vaccination rates in South Korea. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between support for government vacc ination policies and individuals' political affiliations: those aligned with the government are more likely to endorse these policies, while opposition supporters tend to resist them. This trend arises from a preference for news sources that present negati ve content opposing official government views. To test this hypothesis, we employ text analysis to explore differences in coverage of "COVID-19 Vaccination" by conservative and liberal news outlets, revealing a pronounced negativity in reporting from certa in sources. Furthermore, by measuring exposure to conservative news outlets and analyzing regional variations prior to the pandemic, we demonstrate significant disparities in vaccination rates linked to the political orientation of news consumption. These results highlight the critical role of negative vaccine information in shaping public health decision-making.

## The Impact of Wedding Restrictions on Non-Marital Births during COVID-19: Evidence from South Korea

- Authors: [Sok Chul Hong](https://sites.google.com/site/sokchulhong/), Inhyuk Hwang, Dae-il Kim

**Abstract:**
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a steep increase in non-marital births was observed in South Korea, particularly among older mothers. We test the hypothesis that the increase in non marital births is a result of marriage delays caused by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic likely raised the costs of marriage due to infection risks and quarantine policies restricting weddings. Consequently, individuals faced the decision of whether to postpone childbearing as a response to delayed marriage. However, the costs of delay could differ by age. In particular, older women may face higher costs, as late childbearing can negatively affect the health of their offspring. By exploiting variations in COVID-19 infection risk and wedding restrictions, this research will assess the pandemic’s impact on marriage postponements and explore whether non-marital births served as a strategy to offset the anticipated decline in child health due to delayed childbirth. The study’s findings are relevant as they highlight how the COVID 19 pandemic interacts with policy and cultural factors to create demographic effects.
