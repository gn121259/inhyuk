# Impact of Negative News about Covid-19 Vaccine on the Choice of Vaccination

**Abstract:**
 Informed decision-making is a fundamental mechanism within society, exemplified by vaccination choices. During the global COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination emerged as a crucial strategy for mitigating societal risks, yet uncertainty surrounding vaccine side effects persisted. This uncertainty is often exacerbated by the overwhelming volume of information available, leading individuals to selectively engage with preferred news narratives. This study examines the impact of exposure to negative information about vaccines on vaccination rates in South Korea. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between support for government vacc ination policies and individuals' political affiliations: those aligned with the government are more likely to endorse these policies, while opposition supporters tend to resist them. This trend arises from a preference for news sources that present negati ve content opposing official government views. To test this hypothesis, we employ text analysis to explore differences in coverage of "COVID-19 Vaccination" by conservative and liberal news outlets, revealing a pronounced negativity in reporting from certa in sources. Furthermore, by measuring exposure to conservative news outlets and analyzing regional variations prior to the pandemic, we demonstrate significant disparities in vaccination rates linked to the political orientation of news consumption. These results highlight the critical role of negative vaccine information in shaping public health decision-making.

# The Impact of Wedding Restrictions on Non-Marital Births during COVID-19: Evidence from South Korea

- Authors: [Sok Chul Hong](https://sites.google.com/site/sokchulhong/), Inhyuk Hwang, Dae-il Kim

**Abstract:**
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a steep increase in non-marital births was observed in South Korea, particularly among older mothers. We test the hypothesis that the increase in non marital births is a result of marriage delays caused by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic likely raised the costs of marriage due to infection risks and quarantine policies restricting weddings. Consequently, individuals faced the decision of whether to postpone childbearing as a response to delayed marriage. However, the costs of delay could differ by age. In particular, older women may face higher costs, as late childbearing can negatively affect the health of their offspring. By exploiting variations in COVID-19 infection risk and wedding restrictions, this research will assess the pandemic’s impact on marriage postponements and explore whether non-marital births served as a strategy to offset the anticipated decline in child health due to delayed childbirth. The study’s findings are relevant as they highlight how the COVID 19 pandemic interacts with policy and cultural factors to create demographic effects.
